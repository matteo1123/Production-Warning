# PW Focus: Developer Context & Safety

**Manage your environment context: Stay safe in production and focused on your tasks.**

PW Focus harmonizes your developer workflow by making your browser "context-aware." Whether you are deploying code or debugging a complex issue, PW Focus ensures you have the right guardrails and the right resources at the right time.

## 🎯 The Purpose: Context Awareness

Developers constantly switch contexts—between "Production vs. Sandbox" and "Project A vs. Project B." PW Focus unifies these into one tool:
1.  **Safety Context**: "I am in Production" -> **Warn me.**
2.  **Task Context**: "I am working on Ticket #123" -> **Focus me.**

### ⚠️ Context 1: Safety (Production Warnings)
Originally built for Salesforce developers, this feature prevents costly mistakes by visually alerting you when you access specific environments.
- **Automatic Detection**: Define rules (e.g., `*.force.com`, `production`) to identify critical sites.
- **Visual Guardrails**: Your cursor changes to a warning icon (⚠️, 🛑) instantly, reminding you to be careful before you click.
- **Peace of Mind**: Never accidentally delete data in the wrong environment again.

### 🧠 Context 2: Focus (Task Management)
Stop drowning in tabs. Define your "Focus" (e.g., "Deployment", "Q3 Planning") and let the extension organize your browser.
- **Curated Workspaces**: One click opens only the tabs you need for your current task.
- **Smart Overlay**: A non-intrusive bar keeps your critical links (Jira, GitHub, Docs) accessible on every page without switching tabs.
- **AI Assistance**: Chat with your specific context. Ask questions like *"Summarize the errors in these 3 tabs"* and get an answer based only on your active work.

### 🤝 Share Your Context
- **Team Sync**: Share a "Focus" with a colleague. They get your links, your safety rules, and your context notes in one click.
- **Open Source**: Built by developers, for developers. [View Source on GitHub](https://github.com/matteo1123/Production-Warning-extension)
