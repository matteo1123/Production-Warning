# PW Focus Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 7, 2026

## Overview

PW Focus ("we", "our", or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

### Local Data (Stored on Your Device)

PW Focus stores the following data **locally** on your device using Chrome's storage API:

- **Focus configurations**: Names, descriptions, and link collections you create
- **Warning rules**: URL patterns and element selectors for cursor warnings
- **Context notes**: Notes you attach to specific URLs
- **Settings**: Your preferences including data sharing consent

This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to share a focus.

### Data Shared with External Services (Opt-in Only)

**AI Chat Feature**: When you use the "Ask Focus" chat feature AND have enabled data sharing:

- **Page content** from your open focus tabs is extracted and sent to our AI service (Convex) to generate responses
- **Your question** is transmitted to the AI service
- **Anonymous usage data** may be collected to improve the service

You can opt out of data sharing at any time in the Focus Mode Settings. When disabled, all AI chat processing happens without storing data.

### Data Shared with Other Users

**Focus Sharing**: When you choose to share a focus:

- Focus name, description, links, and warnings are transmitted to our sharing service (pwfocus.net)
- A shareable link is generated that other users can use to import your focus

This only happens when you explicitly click the share button.

## What We Don't Collect

We do **NOT** collect:

- Your browsing history
- Passwords or authentication credentials
- Financial information
- Personal identifiers (name, email, etc.)
- Data from websites not in your active focus

## How We Use Your Information

- **Focus configurations**: To display your curated links and settings
- **Warning rules**: To show visual alerts on matching websites
- **Context notes**: To display your notes on matching pages
- **AI chat data**: To provide answers about your focus tab content (only when opted in)

## Data Security

- All local data is stored using Chrome's secure storage API
- Data shared with external services is transmitted over HTTPS
- We do not sell or share your data with third parties for marketing purposes

## Your Rights

You can:

- View all your data in the extension's settings pages
